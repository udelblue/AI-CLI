1. Roof: The roof should be inspected and serviced at least once a year, preferably before the start of the rainy season. In addition to annual inspections, it's a good idea to check for damage after severe weather events.

2. HVAC system: The HVAC system should be serviced at least once a year by a professional technician. It is recommended to schedule maintenance before the start of the heating or cooling season to ensure optimal performance.

3. Gutters: Gutters should be cleaned and inspected twice a year, typically in the spring and fall. However, if your house is surrounded by trees or experiences heavy rainfall, more frequent cleanings may be necessary to prevent clogs and water damage.
